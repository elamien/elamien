"In the future, there will be immersive learning technology that will automatically adapt to a student's needs. The technology will be able to serve up information and ensure the information sticks and actually gets committed to long-term memory, and ensure that students remain proficient in the skills they need to move on. There may be stuff that works while you are sleeping." ~ Joe Porter in response to "Is artificial intelligence (AI) good or bad for todayâ€™s education system?"

Remove all limitations for a moment and imagine the impact of the best "if it were to be possible to..." ideas, then come back to reality and work with or expand the limitations to make those ideas a reality. 

SRS, Active recall, pattern recognition, AI, human cognition, vision, language, and many more great tools already exist, they just need someone to be crazy enough to make a robust and successful system utilizing them in effort to advance learning by factors. This is what I care about most.
